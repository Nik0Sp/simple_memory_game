## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:Nik0Sp/simple_memory_game.git`
2. Change directory to the project folder: `cd simple_memory_code`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the development server: `npm start`
5. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to play the memory game.

## How to Play

- Click on the cards to reveal emojis.
- The goal is to find matching pairs of emojis.
- When two cards are opened:
  - If they match, they stay open.
  - If they don't match, they close back.
- Continue until you find all matching pairs.
- The game ends with an alert "win" when all pairs are found.

##  Reset Game

If you want to reset the game, click the "Reset" button, and the game board will be cleared, and a new shuffled set of emojis will be displayed.
